# Chef Me The Way - A Recipe App for You

Chef Me the Way is a node-based web app that allows users to satisfy their cravings by suggesting recipes along with full ingredient lists based on a simple search. After authenticating the user via a log-in with password support, the user navigates to the search page and is prompted with "What are you hungry for?" Search for anything, from a simple query like chicken to more complicated recipes like fried chicken sandwiches with hot sauce mayonnaise. The results appear in a dynamically-created table, where they can save as many recipes as they'd like for later use, accessible via their personal account page.

## Packages 

npm, express, session, cookieparser, bodyparser, morgan, passport, flash, handlebars

## Current Issues

* Users are unable to save recipes to push to a mySQL database.
* Custom CSS causes certain portions of the app to break, such as preventing users from seeing the recipe table after search.
* File structure must be organized for better ease of use for developers.
